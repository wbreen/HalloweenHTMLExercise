     <h2>Welcome to my site. Please come in and stay awhile</h2>
      <p>
      I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite holiday.
      But during the last year, I started selling some of my favorite Halloween products,
      and they've become quite a hit.

       If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween pictures, 
        stories, and films. And if you join my email list, I will keep you up-to-date on 
        all things Halloween.
